# Campaign-Response-Prediction-and-Revenue-Increase 📊

## Overview

In this project an online delivery service's customers are segmented and a model is built that correctly predicts users that will respond positively to their campaign messages, hence improving revenue.

By the end of this project, a model capable of predicting customers who will accept iFood’s campaigns, with an accuracy rate of 87%, will be developed. However, it is noticed that iFood has a low acceptance rate from its customers, which is potentially impacting its revenue. Two solutions (improve customer engagement and include family-friendly deals) will be recommended to increase acceptance rate and revenue.
